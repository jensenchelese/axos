## Part 1 Questions
1.a)  
<ul>
<li>Go to the website </li>
<li>Right click and select 'View Page Source'</li>
<ul>
<li>This takes you to a page with the html</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I copy the html document into my own html document</li>
<li>Then I open my html document and view the errors in the Dev Console </li>
<li>I go through each error and fix the urls that are not complete in my html document. Most links required 'https://www.beautystatcosmetics.com/' at the beginning so I was able to search the links and update all at once.</li>
</ul>

1.b)  
I would do a few things to be sure I minimize errors. I would first be sure that I am comparing the copied website to the origional to see if there are any differences. I would also open the console and read each error and address each one to the best of my ability. For example, most of the errors were addressing invalid urls. So I would search the origional html for that url and then select the url and get the complete url to add to my html.


1.c)  
I would need to eliminate scripts if they are not open to the public. In this case, all of the CSS files were open to the public but if I were not able to find the CSS I would either have to recreate it or eliminate it completely. 

1.d)  
As mentioned before, if I were not able to find a script I would have to either replace it by recreating my own, finding something similar, or contacting the creator.

1.e)  
See index.html file for cloned version of site!
