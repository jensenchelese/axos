Note: I would have liked to create a search that allowed the user to find artists based on keywords or incomplete artist names. However, there was not a method provided on this API that allowed for this feature. I could have found an outside source database that contains artists names and implemented this feature but I felt that this would have defeated the purpose of this assignment. Thank you!
