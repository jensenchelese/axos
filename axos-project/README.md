# AxosProject

1. Fork and Clone Repo
2. Open Repo in terminal
3. Visit stock.service.ts file and paste API key in the marked location
4. To run, execute 'ng serve --open' in the terminal

Note: I was not sure how sensitive the API key is so I chose to exclude it and just include directions to where to place it. In other circumstances I would have created a config file and placed the key there but thought I would save you the work of having to create a new file. If you would like this done using a different approach I am willing to do so. Thank you!
